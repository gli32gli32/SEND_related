# SEND_related
On initiation
As a toxicologist in a biotech company and CRO, I have come across a number of SEND datasets.  This project would be focus on data virtualizaion, generation of submitable .xpt files, generation of define.xml with R language. By the way, I am very new to R and R shiny and with none programming background. This project means more to me as entertainment.
